A partner and I were responsible for writing the main processing software and the user interface of a digital dashboard.
The digital dashboard had to display useful information to the driver based on the input sensory data provided. 
We were to use different classes and member functions of these classes in an effort to make the code more mangable. 
Our grade for our final project was 110% due to the visual effects and extra graphs included in the program.
The project being very visual was designed to be ran on a laptop so on some screens will cut out some of the graphs displayed on the bottom.
